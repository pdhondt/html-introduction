    <h4>Funny Story</h4>
        <p>In my younger/wilder years, when I used to go out with friends, it sometimes happened they had to come and
        find me at the end of the night, before going home, because I had "mysteriously" disappeared.  And no, not
        because I was a Don Juan and went home with the most beautiful girl of the evening, but because - when I had
        too much to drink - I got so tired that I locked myself in the toilet to take a nap.</p>

    <h5>TL;DR</h5>
        <p>I'm a lousy drinker</p>
